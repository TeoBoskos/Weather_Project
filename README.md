# My Weather App
This app uses WeatherAPI to fetch live weather data for a specific city in the
world and display it in the UI. However, because I have the free trial for the API
it will be functional until 12/1/2025. Sometime in the future, I may make the
app better and buy a paid plan for the API.

## What does the app do?
Once started, the user must input his/her desired city in the input field and
press the button besides it to get the temperature and the weather condition
for that specific city.
Depending on the weather condition, the image on the right side of the app
changes (at the time of uploading this there are only four images), I may
update it in the future.

## Why did I make this?
The reason I made this is, obviously, not to inform the world about live weather
data around the world. I just wanted to test my skills on Tkinter and retrieving
data from an API.

Thanks for reading.
